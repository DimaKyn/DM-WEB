        "explanation": "Your BMI (Body Mass Index) score is below 16, it indicates that you are classified as severely underweight. BMI is a measurement that assesses the relationship between your height and weight to determine if you are within a healthy weight range.

        "steps": [
            "Consult a healthcare professional: It is crucial to seek guidance from a healthcare provider, such as a doctor or a registered dietitian. They can assess your specific circumstances, conduct a thorough evaluation, and provide personalized advice to help you increase your BMI safely.",
            "Evaluate your diet: Focus on consuming a well-balanced and nutritious diet. Include foods that are rich in calories, healthy fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. Examples of energy-dense foods include avocados, nuts, seeds, whole grains, lean meats, and dairy products. Incorporate a variety of fruits and vegetables to ensure you receive essential vitamins and minerals.",
            "Increase your calorie intake: To raise your BMI, you need to consume more calories than your body burns. Consider gradually increasing your portion sizes and adding healthy snacks between meals. However, it's essential to choose nutrient-dense foods rather than relying on unhealthy, high-calorie processed foods.",
            "Eat frequently: Instead of having three large meals, try dividing your daily food intake into smaller, more frequent meals and snacks throughout the day. This approach can make it easier to consume more calories without feeling overly full or overwhelmed.",
            "Strength training and exercise: Engaging in strength training exercises can help build muscle mass, which contributes to weight gain. Consult a fitness professional to design an exercise routine that suits your needs and helps you gain healthy weight.",
            "Avoid excessive cardio exercises: While cardiovascular exercise is important for overall health, excessive cardio can burn more calories and make it challenging to gain weight. Focus more on strength training and resistance exercises to promote muscle growth.",
            "Stay hydrated: Drinking enough water is essential for overall health, including weight gain. Make sure to stay adequately hydrated throughout the day, as it supports your body's functions and can help maintain a healthy appetite.",
            "Monitor your progress: Regularly track your weight and BMI to monitor your progress. However, remember that the goal should be gradual and sustainable weight gain. Aim for a healthy increase in BMI over time rather than trying to achieve rapid results."
